# Database Technology course
Hi and welcome to the course in databases!
This repo is structured like the labs should be handed in.
If any instructions are unclear please create an Issue and assign Alexander Dahl (aleda145) to it.

## The labs
This course has 4 labs. The first two are introductions to MySQL and database design.
Lab 3 is about functional dependencies.
And lab 4 is a bigger project where everything you've learned in the three previous labs will be used.

## Handing in labs
All labs should be handed in through gitlab.ida.liu.se. You can create a new repo or fork this one.
