# Database Technology course
Welcome to the Database Technology course!

This course has 4 lab assignments:

* Lab 1 introduces SQL
* Lab 2 introduces database design
* Lab 3 is about functional dependencies and normalization
* Lab 4 is a bigger project in which you will create a database for a hypothetical airline company

Please find the instructions for these assignments on the course Website.

We want you to manage your solutions to the lab assignments in a gitlab repository; that repository should be a *private* fork of the repository [olaha93/database_technology](https://gitlab.ida.liu.se/olaha93/database_technology). A fork is essentially a copy of the repository that goes under your own account.

In the following, we describe the process of i) creating such a forked repository and ii) handing in your solutions via that repository.

### 1. Fork this repository

Press the "Fork" button on the top of this page to copy this repository to your account.

Then, choose your account on this page:

---

After successfully forking the repository, you will see a message such as the following:

### 2. Make your fork private

Your forked repository has to be made private so that others do not have access to it.

Find the "Setting" button on the left of this page, and click 'General' to change the permission of your project.

Expand 'Permissions' and set 'Project visibility' as 'Private', then save changes.

### 3. Provide access to your fork for your lab partner and for your lab assistant

You could find 'Member' option under 'Setting' on the left of this page

Follow the steps as shown in the image below to provide access to your lab partner and lab assistant

### 4. Work on the lab assignments

You need to download the content of your repository.

After you have the content of your repository on your computer, you can start working on the lab assignments. Notice that the repository contains four folders, one for each of the four lab assignments. **Check these folders for more detailed instructions about what needs to be handed in for the corresponding lab assignment.**

### 5. Handing in labs

After completing an assignment, edit/upload the files to your GitLab repository so that your lab assistant can check your work online.

If there exists an example report in the directory (e.g. lab1), please open and edit the file:

If there is no file in the directory (e.g. lab4), please upload files from your computer:

<img src="/clarifying_pictures/upload.png"  width="500">

To submit your solution for a lab assignment, email a link of your repository to your lab assistant; the subject for that email should adhere to the following pattern: **"CourseCode_year_userName1_userName2_labNumber"** (e.g., TDDD37_2019_hrsdv94_dgjjtd92_lab2).


Labs that are handed in incorrectly will be rejected and your assistant will ask you to correct the assignment. 

**Labs do not need to be demonstrated during the lab session**.
