# Database Technology course
Hi and welcome to the course in databases!
This repo is structured like the labs should be handed in.
If any instructions are unclear please create an Issue and assign Alexander Dahl (aleda145) to it.

## The labs
This course has 4 labs. The first two are introductions to MySQL and database design.
Lab 3 is about functional dependencies.
And lab 4 is a bigger project where everything you've learned in the three previous labs will be used.

## Gitlab
All labs should be handed in through gitlab.ida.liu.se. 
Create a new project in gitlab and name it "<Course Code>_<liu_id 1>_<liu_id 2>". So for the course TDDD37 name your repo "TDDD37_aleda145_aleda146".
After a project has been created click "members" under options in the top right corner. 
![members](clarifying_pictures/members.jpg "members")
Add your lab assistant as a developer in the members tab.

## Handing in labs
When you have completed a lab and confirmed that everything is according to the instructions in gitlab you can hand it in.
Labs that are handed in incorrectly will be denied and your assistant will ask for a correctly done hand in. 

You hand in the labs by creating an issue, specifying which lab you are handing in and then assigning your lab assistant to the issue.
![issue](clarifying_pictures/issue.jpg "issue")

When your lab assistant has looked at your hand in the feedback will be put on WebReg and you will get an email to your student email about it. The issue will also be closed.
