You need to download the content of your repository. The repository contains four folders, each corresponding to a lab.

**Check the folders for hand in instructions for each lab**

Then do a lab according to the provided instructions.

### 3. Handing in labs

After completing an assignment, edit/upload the files to your GitLab repository so that your lab assistant can check your work online.

To submit a lab, email a link of your repository to your lab assistant, under a subject: **"CourseCode_year_userName1_userName2_labNumber"** (e.g. TDDD37_2019_hrsdv94_dgjjtd92_lab2)


Labs that are handed in incorrectly will be rejected and your assistant will ask you to correct the assignment. 

**Labs do not need to be demonstrated during the lab session**.
