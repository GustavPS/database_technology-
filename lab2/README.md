# The lab report
The report should contain: (all files should be placed in the gitlab folder)
* A lab2.sql file with the code, same instructions as in lab1. Question 3 should be answered as a comment in the file. 
* A jpg of the finished EER-diagram (with all extensions made in question 5)
* A jpg of the finished Relational Model (with all extensions made in question 5)

## EER-diagram
In this folder there is an XML file that contains the EER-diagram. Download and upload it to [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). 
Make your changes in draw.io and when you are finished export the diagram as a jpg and add it to your project.
