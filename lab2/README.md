# The lab report
The report should contain: (all files should be placed in the gitlab folder)
* A lab2.sql file with the code, same instructions as in lab1. 
* A jpg of the finished EER-diagram (with all extensions made in question 5 and all cardinalities)
* A jpg of the finished Relational Model (with all extensions made in question 5)

## EER-diagram
In this folder there is an XML file that contains the EER-diagram. Download and upload it to [draw.io](https://www.draw.io). 
Make your changes in draw.io and when you are finished export the diagram as a jpg and add it to your project. 


## Relational Model (RM) 
Same procedure for the Relational Model as for the EER-diagram. There is an example XML file in the repo. 

It is not complete, you will have to fill in the remaining relations yourselves. 

## Lab2.sql
Like Lab 1: 

Question 3 should be answered as a comment in the file.
