# Lab 4 

Lab 4 is a big project that contains different parts. 

## Part 1
For the first part the following should be handed in:

* EER-diagram
* Relational Model
* Functional dependencies for all relations

### EER-diagram and Relational Model
Same as in lab 2, do it in draw.io and add it to gitlab

### Functional depdencies 
Find the Candidate keys, primary keys and whether the table is in BCNF or not. If it is not in BCNF, motivate why! 

## Part 2
This is the coding phase of the project. Do not start coding until your EER and RM is approved!

The following should be handed in: 

* EER-diagram 
* Relational Model 
* Functional dependencies for all relations
* Project code as a file named lab4.sql
* Answers to the non code questions as comments in the lab4.sql file, place them at the end of the file
* An identified secondary index as a comments in the lab4.sql file (do not implement it), place at the end of the file

## Part 3
