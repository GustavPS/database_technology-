Question 8:
 - How can you protect the credit card information in the database from hackers?
       We can encrypt the data that we store in that table, if we use som sort of hash function
       and also use a random salt it will become difficult for hackers to decrypt the credit card
       data.
 - Give three advantages of using stored procedures in the database (and thereby
   execute them on the server) instead of writing the same functions in the frontend of the system (in for example
   java-script on a web-page)?
       If you use javascript it is possible for the user to modify the script since the code is visible to the
       user, this can create a security issue so because of this it is safer to use stored procedure in the
       database. The DBMS is also very fast and it is more efficient to run procedures in the database and just
       send the result back to the front-end client instead of letting the front-end client do the calculations on
       the data.

Question 9:
A:
 Session B:
   START TRANSACTION;
 Session A:
   START TRANSACTION;
   CALL addReservation('HOB', 'MIT', 2011, 52, 'Sunday', '12:00:00', 2, @r);
B:
 No, we cannot see the new Reservation in transaction B since it is 'based' on an earlier state of the database,
 and will not see the new reservation (they are isolated).
C:
 SESSION B:
  CALL addContact(5, 1, '1@gmail.com', 702857710);
  ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction
 Session B will wait until session A commits its transaction, this is because of isolation since transaction A
 prevents (locks) transaction B from executing queries that modifies data that transaction A has locked.

Question 10:
 A:
  An overbooking did not occur when the scripts where executed, this is because the first addPayment was executed
  and completed before the next addPayment was executed.
 B:
  An overbooking cannot occur since we are using transactions inside the addPayment procedure. If we did this
  without transaction it would be possible, for example if it executed in this order:
   Session 1: SET freeSeats = calculateFreeSeats(flight);
   Session 2: SET freeSeats = calculateFreeSeats(flight);
   // Now both have the same freeSeats value
   Session 2: IF freeSeats >= reservationSeats THEN
   Session 1: IF freeSeats >= reservationSeats THEN
  Both will pass this IF-statement since neither of them has actually created the booking yet.
